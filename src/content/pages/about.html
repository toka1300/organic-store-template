                <h2 class="cs-title">We are proudly committed to organic & local products</h2>
                <p class="cs-text">
                    What began as a small startup in 2018 has blossomed from a simple online marketplace connecting just five farms to nearby neighborhoods into a thriving community of over 50 family farms and artisanal producers, serving thousands of households across the state. Founded by two local food advocates who noticed a disconnect between small-scale organic farmers and consumers hungry for fresh, sustainably grown food, the company has become a cornerstone of the region's agricultural community.
                </p>
                <p class="cs-text">
                    Our mission extends beyond just delivering fresh produce â€“ we're building a more resilient and sustainable local food system. Through our transparent pricing model, farmers receive fair compensation for their hard work, while customers enjoy access to seasonal, organic produce at reasonable prices. We also work closely with our farming partners to minimize food waste through careful planning and our popular "ugly produce" program, which has saved over 100,000 pounds of perfectly good fruits and vegetables from going to waste. Every delivery represents our commitment to nurturing both our environment and our community.
                </p>

                    <p class="cs-flex-p">
                        When I walk through our partner farms and see the care that goes into every crop, or when I read messages from customers about how our deliveries have transformed their family meals, I'm reminded of why we started this journey.
